## Overview
I took this challenge to improve my html and css skills, see how senoirs developers orginize their code and use best practices. I'm still learning and I'm open to any feedback.

## My process
I started by viewing the design that was provided to me. I tried to break it down into smaller components and imagine wich css goups should i make and how to orginize my html.
I started by making the drops, then the main section. I used css flex-box to orginize the main section. I made the chat section and the user section. I used flexbox to orginize the user section. I used css variables to make the code more readable and easy to change. I used media queries to make the design responsive. I used css animations to animate the chat section on the initial load.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### Continued development

I want to learn more about css animations and how to use them in my projects.
